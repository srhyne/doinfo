### Why doinfo? 

- Tired of opening up the Digital Ocean console and it's painfully slow droplet search? Use `fetch` and `search`!
- Tired of cross checking IP firewalls and configs with droplet names? Use `reveal`!
- Tired of keeping your /etc/hosts file in sync? Use `hosts` to generate one!
- Tired of checking if ports are open/closed? Use `scan`!
